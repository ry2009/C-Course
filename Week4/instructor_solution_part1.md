### 3. Integration Architecture

Students should demonstrate how components interact through:

   - Matching Engine → Risk Management → Position Keeper
   - Bidirectional flows between Order Management and clients

2. **Synchronization Mechanisms:**

   - Well-defined interfaces and responsibilities
   - Minimal dependencies between modules

2. **Scalability:**
   - Horizontal scaling for stateless components
   - Vertical scaling for performance-critical components
   - Partitioning strategies for data distribution

3. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - No single points of failure
   - Graceful degradation under load

   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Predictable performance under varying loads

5. **Security:**

   - Audit trails for all operations

### 5. Grading Considerations

When evaluating student submissions for Part 1, consider:

- **Completeness:** All required components are specified with inputs/outputs
- **Consistency:** Architecture is internally consistent and follows industry practices
- **Trade-offs:** CAP theorem trade-offs are explicitly stated and justified
- **Practicality:** Design addresses real-world challenges in trading systems
- **Integration:** Clear demonstration of how components interact
- **Documentation:** Clear diagrams and explanations

## Sample Implementation Notes

The following notes can guide discussions with students who struggle:

- For market data processing, emphasize the importance of fast path vs. slow path processing
- Order management should prioritize correctness over speed, while matching engines do the opposite
- Risk systems should fail closed (reject when uncertain) rather than fail open
- Strategy engines often use staged deployment (shadow → limited → full)
