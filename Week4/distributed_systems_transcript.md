# Distributed Systems in Trading - Teaching Transcript

## Introduction

Today we'll explore how distributed systems concepts are applied in high-frequency trading systems like trade-ngin. We'll focus on the key challenges and solutions for maintaining performance and consistency in a distributed trading environment.

## Distributed Trading Architecture

Here we see a typical distributed trading system with four nodes. Each node represents a complete trading system capable of:
- Processing market data
- Executing strategies
- Managing orders
- Handling risk

The nodes are connected through a high-performance network, with typical latencies between 50-100 microseconds. This low latency is crucial for maintaining consistency across the distributed system.

## Order Book Replication

One of the most critical aspects of distributed trading is maintaining consistent order books across all nodes. Each node maintains its own copy of the order book, shown here in blue.

The order books are kept in sync through a replication protocol that:
- Minimizes latency
- Ensures consistency
- Handles network partitions
- Recovers from failures

## Time Synchronization

Time synchronization is crucial in distributed trading. Each node uses NTP or PTP (Precision Time Protocol) to maintain synchronized clocks, shown here by the red circles.

Accurate time synchronization is essential for:
- Order sequencing
- Trade fairness
- Regulatory compliance
- Performance measurement

## Performance Metrics

Let's look at the key performance metrics for a distributed trading system:

1. Order Book Sync: Target < 100μs, Achieved 75μs
   - Measures time to propagate order book updates
   - Critical for maintaining consistency

2. Network Latency: Target < 50μs, Achieved 45μs
   - Round-trip time between nodes
   - Impacts overall system responsiveness

3. Time Sync: Target < 1μs, Achieved 0.8μs
   - Clock synchronization accuracy
   - Affects order sequencing

4. Throughput: Target 1M+ msg/s, Achieved 1.2M msg/s
   - Messages processed per second
   - Indicates system capacity

## Key Challenges

1. **Consistency vs. Latency**
   - Trade-off between strong consistency and low latency
   - Different strategies for different use cases

2. **Network Partitions**
   - Handling network failures
   - Maintaining system availability
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Clock Drift**
   - Managing time synchronization
   - Handling clock adjustments
   - Impact on trading decisions

4. **Load Balancing**
   - Distributing workload
   - Handling hot spots
   - Scaling strategies

## Best Practices

1. **Design for Failure**
   - Assume components will fail
   - Build redundancy
   - Plan recovery procedures

2. **Measure Everything**
   - Monitor latencies
   - Track consistency
   - Measure throughput

3. **Optimize for Latency**
   - Minimize network hops
   - Use efficient protocols
   - Optimize message size

4. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Use appropriate consistency models
   - Handle conflicts
   - Verify correctness

## Conclusion

Distributed systems in trading require careful balance between:
- Performance and consistency
- Availability and reliability
- Latency and throughput

By understanding these trade-offs and implementing appropriate solutions, we can build robust, high-performance distributed trading systems.
