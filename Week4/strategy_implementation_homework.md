# Trade-ngin Strategy Implementation Homework

## Overview
Implement a distributed, high-performance trading strategy that leverages concepts from all four weeks of the course. Your strategy should demonstrate understanding of sorting algorithms, memory management, threading, and distributed systems.

## Strategy Requirements

### Week 1: Order Book Management
- Implement efficient order book sorting using Week 1's algorithms
- Maintain bid/ask queues with O(log n) operations
- Handle market data updates with minimal latency

### Week 2: Memory Optimization
- Use custom memory pools for order objects
- Implement cache-friendly data structures
- Optimize memory access patterns for high-frequency trading

### Week 3: Threading and Synchronization
- Design a thread-safe strategy execution pipeline
- Use lock-free data structures for market data processing
- Implement proper thread synchronization for position updates

### Week 4: Distributed Systems
- Design a distributed version of your strategy
- Implement network latency optimization
- Handle time synchronization across nodes

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Core Strategy Class
```cpp
class DistributedStrategy : public BaseStrategy {
private:
    // Week 1: Order book management
    OrderBook order_book_;
    
    // Week 2: Memory management
    MemoryPool<Order> order_pool_;
    
    // Week 3: Threading
    ThreadPool execution_pool_;
    LockFreeQueue<Signal> signal_queue_;
    
    // Week 4: Distributed systems
    NetworkManager network_manager_;
    TimeSynchronizer time_sync_;
};
```

### 2. Performance Requirements
