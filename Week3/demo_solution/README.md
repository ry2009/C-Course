# Trading System Demo Solution

This demo solution demonstrates how components from Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3 integrate together to form a complete trading system.

## Overview

The trading system consists of the following key components:

1. **Market Data Handler** (Week 3) - Thread-safe handler for processing market updates
2. **Thread Pool** (Week 3) - Priority-based thread pool for executing trading strategies
3. **Lock-Free Queue** (Week 3) - High-performance queue for passing trading signals between components
4. **Memory Management** (Week 2) - Custom allocators for efficient memory usage in high-frequency trading
5. **Sorting Algorithms** (Week 1) - Efficient algorithms for sorting order book data

## Integration Points

### Week 1 Integration (Sorting Algorithms)

Week 1 sorting algorithms are used in the `MarketDataHandler` to maintain the order book. The order book bids and asks need to be sorted by price (bids in descending order, asks in ascending order).

### Week 2 Integration (Memory Management)

Week 2 memory management components are used to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory for order books. The `MarketDataHandler` uses a custom allocator (`OrderBookAllocator`) to manage memory for order books.

### Week 3 Components (Threading)

Week 3 introduces threading components that enable concurrent processing:

- `MarketDataHandler`: Thread-safe handler for market data with lock-based synchronization
- `ThreadPool`: Worker thread pool for parallel execution of trading strategies with priority support
- `LockFreeQueue`: Lock-free data structure for passing trading signals between components

## Building and Running

```bash
# Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build
make

# Run the integrated system test
./bin/integrated_system_test
```

## Expected Output

The integrated system test demonstrates:

1. Setting up the market data handler with multiple exchanges
2. Creating trading strategies with different priorities
3. Processing market updates through the thread pool
4. Generating trading signals based on strategy evaluations
5. Retrieving and displaying order book data

The output will show the configuration, processing statistics, and the final state of the order books.

## System Requirements

- CMake 3.10 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Threading support

## For Students

This demo solution shows what your final implementation should achieve after completing all the homework assignments. Your own implementation may differ in details, but should maintain the same integration points and functionality.

Key learning points:

1. How sorting algorithms are used for maintaining order books
2. How memory management improves performance of high-frequency trading systems
3. How threading and synchronization enable concurrent processing of market data
4. How different components work together to form a complete trading system
