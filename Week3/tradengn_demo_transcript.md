# Trade-Ngin Threading Architecture - Teaching Transcript

## Introduction to Trade-Ngin

Today I'm going to walk you through how threading is specifically implemented in Trade-Ngin, our production high-frequency trading system. Unlike general-purpose trading platforms, Trade-Ngin incorporates specialized threading techniques that give us a competitive edge in low-latency environments.

## System Architecture Overview

This is the high-level architecture of Trade-Ngin. As you can see, we have four main components, each with its own threading model:

The Market Data Processor receives and processes exchange feeds, the Strategy Engine analyzes this data and generates signals, the Risk Management component validates orders and monitors positions, and the Order Management System handles the actual execution of trades.

Each component has been carefully optimized with a specific thread allocation strategy. Our Market Data Processor uses 8-16 threads to handle multiple exchange connections simultaneously. The Strategy Engine is our most thread-intensive component, running 10-30 threads for different strategy instances. Risk Management operates with 2-4 threads for continuous validation, while Order Management employs 4-6 threads for order generation and execution.

## Market Data Processing Pipeline

Let's take a closer look at how threading works in our Market Data Processing component. This is one of the most performance-critical parts of the system.

Here you can see our exchange feed at the top. Data from the exchanges flows down through our thread pipeline as follows:

First, the Receiver Threads - we have 8-16 of these, with typically one dedicated thread per exchange connection. These threads do minimal processing - they just receive the raw data from the network and place it into buffers.

Next, the Parser Threads - 4-8 of these convert the binary exchange protocols into our internal data representation. We use zero-copy techniques here to avoid unnecessary memory operations.

Then, the Order Book Threads - 8-12 threads that apply the market data updates to our in-memory order books. Each thread is responsible for a subset of symbols to prevent lock contention.

Finally, Analytics Threads - 2-4 threads calculate derived statistics like VWAP, imbalance metrics, and signals for the strategy engine.

## Lock-Free Ring Buffer

A key innovation in Trade-Ngin is our lock-free ring buffer, shown here on the right. This data structure enables thread-to-thread communication without locks or mutexes.

The ring buffer is a circular queue with atomic read and write pointers. Multiple producer threads can write to the buffer while multiple consumer threads read from it, all without blocking. 

The write pointer, shown in red, indicates where the next item will be written. The read pointer, in green, shows where the next read will occur. This design eliminates a critical bottleneck in many trading systems - threads waiting on locks. By using lock-free data structures, Trade-Ngin ensures that market data processing continues smoothly even during market volume spikes.

## Strategy Execution Threading

Now let's examine how threading works in our Strategy Engine. This component uses several categories of threads:

Signal Generation Threads - We dedicate one thread per strategy instance, typically running 10-30 strategies simultaneously. Each thread runs independently to prevent one strategy from impacting others.

Alpha Calculation Thread Pool - This is a shared pool of 4-8 worker threads handling computationally intensive calculations like correlation matrices or regression models.

Position Management Thread - A single dedicated thread that manages the consolidated position across all strategies, ensuring a consistent view of risk.

On the left, you can see our thread pipeline approach. Rather than having each strategy process data end-to-end, we divide strategies into stages with different threads handling different parts of the calculation:

Strategy Thread 1 performs initial calculations, then passes results to Strategy Thread 2 for further processing, which then passes to the Order Generation thread. This pipeline approach allows for higher throughput and better CPU cache utilization.

We also employ careful CPU pinning to maximize cache efficiency. As you can see in the command example, we use numactl to ensure that all threads run on the same NUMA node, with memory allocated locally to minimize latency.

## Hot Path Optimization

One of the most critical innovations in Trade-Ngin is what we call the "hot path" - a sequence of threads dedicated to the most latency-sensitive operations. The hot path consists of:
- A Strategy Thread that makes trading decisions, an Order Thread that prepares orders, and an Execution Thread that handles order transmission.

These critical path threads receive special treatment:
- They're pinned to dedicated CPU cores that don't handle any other tasks
- They use real-time scheduling priorities to prevent preemption
- Their memory pages are locked to prevent paging to disk
- They avoid all system calls that might block execution

In Trade-Ngin, these hot path threads achieve remarkable performance - processing a market event, making a trading decision, and submitting an order in as little as 50 microseconds.

## Performance Measurements

Here you can see actual performance measurements from Trade-Ngin in production. We track the latency distribution of each component:

Market Data Processing typically takes 3-5 microseconds per update, represented by the blue histogram.

Strategy Execution takes 10-20 microseconds per signal, shown in green.

Order Generation requires 5-8 microseconds per order, displayed in red.

Our end-to-end latency from market data reception to order submission ranges from 50-100 microseconds, which puts us among the fastest systems in the industry.

These measurements are tracked using high-precision histograms that record not just averages but the full distribution of latencies. This allows us to detect outliers and tail latencies that might impact trading performance.

## Real-World Challenges

Of course, implementing this threading architecture in production wasn't without challenges. Here are some of the issues we encountered and how we resolved them:

First, exchange connection threads occasionally blocked on socket I/O, causing delays. We solved this by implementing non-blocking I/O with dedicated event polling threads.

Second, our initial Java implementation suffered from garbage collection pauses. We addressed this by moving critical components to C++ with custom memory management.

Third, we experienced priority inversion, where high-priority threads waited for low-priority ones. The solution was implementing priority inheritance protocol for all locks.

Fourth, thread startup jitter affected latency predictability. We solved this by pre-starting and warming up all threads during system initialization.

## Lessons from Production

Running Trade-Ngin in production environments has taught us several key lessons about threading in high-performance trading systems:

1. Measure Everything - Thread performance in theory often differs dramatically from reality. Continuous measurement is essential for optimization.

2. System Interactions Matter - OS scheduling, network interrupts, and other processes can significantly impact thread performance. Isolating critical threads is crucial.

3. Start Simple - Begin with a simpler threading model and add complexity only where needed based on measurement. Premature optimization is a common pitfall.

4. Test Under Stress - Many threading issues only appear under extreme market conditions - high volume, volatile markets, or network congestion. Rigorous stress testing is essential.

## Conclusion

By applying these specialized threading techniques, Trade-Ngin achieves consistent microsecond-level latencies that give our traders a competitive edge in today's markets.

The combination of dedicated thread allocation, lock-free data structures, pipeline processing, and hot path optimization has allowed us to build a system that consistently outperforms competitors in terms of both latency and throughput.
