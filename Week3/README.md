# Week 3: Concurrency and Parallelism in C++ for Financial Applications

## Overview

In Week 3, we'll explore concurrency and parallelism in C++, with a focus on techniques that are essential for high-performance financial applications. We'll learn how to leverage multi-core processors, SIMD instructions, and modern C++ concurrency features to build efficient and responsive financial systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. **Design thread-safe financial data structures** that minimize contention
2. **Implement parallel algorithms** for financial calculations and data processing
3. **Utilize SIMD instructions** to accelerate vector operations common in financial models
4. **Apply modern C++ concurrency features** (std::thread, std::async, std::future) effectively
5. **Analyze and resolve concurrency issues** such as race conditions and deadlocks
6. **Benchmark and optimize** concurrent financial applications

- Code examples (will be available in Resources/Code_Examples)
- Recommended readings (listed below)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Parallel Portfolio Risk Calculation

Implement a parallel algorithm for calculating Value at Risk (VaR) across a large portfolio of financial instruments. Compare the performance against a sequential implementation with different portfolio sizes.

### Exercise 2: SIMD-Accelerated Option Pricing

Implement a Black-Scholes option pricing model using SIMD instructions (via std::experimental::simd or compiler intrinsics) to price multiple options simultaneously. Benchmark the performance improvement over scalar code.

### Exercise 3: Thread-Safe Market Data Cache

Design and implement a thread-safe cache for market data that allows multiple reader threads and occasional writer threads with minimal contention. The cache should provide fast access to the latest price data for a large number of financial instruments.

## Homework Assignment

1. Extend your parallel VaR calculation to include stress testing scenarios, maintaining high performance even with increased computational demands.
2. Implement a thread pool for managing a fixed number of worker threads processing financial calculations, with a focus on minimizing context switching and maximizing throughput.
3. Write a short report (1-2 pages) analyzing a concurrency bottleneck in a financial application and proposing a solution using modern C++ techniques.

## Submission Guidelines
